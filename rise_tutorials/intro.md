## What is RISE?
RISE-MICCAI is a dedicated initiative aimed at increasing the representation and participation of researchers from under-represented regions in the Medical Image Computing and Computer-Aided Interventions (MICCAI) community. These regions include Latin America, South/Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. 

### Why RISE Matters
Despite their potential contributions, researchers from these regions face significant barriers to entry, including limited funding, networking opportunities, and institutional support. In MICCAI 2020, submissions from these regions accounted for only 4% of total papers, with just 6 out of 103 countries represented in accepted papersâ€”amounting to less than 2% of all accepted papers. RISE-MICCAI aims to bridge this gap by fostering inclusiveness and support.

## Our Goals
The core objectives of RISE-MICCAI are to:
- **Increase Inclusiveness and Geographic Diversity**: Promote participation from under-represented regions in MICCAI conferences and research initiatives.
- **Strengthen Minority Researcher Presence in LMICs**: Provide resources and support to researchers from Low-to-Middle Income Countries (LMICs).
- **Empower MICCAI Researchers in LMICs**: Offer mentorship, funding opportunities, and community-driven support to help researchers advance in their careers.
- **Create Future Research Leaders**: Cultivate and support emerging talents in LMICs, helping them gain visibility and recognition.
- **Build a Strong Research Network**: Foster collaborations across different regions, institutions, and continents to address global disparities in medical imaging and healthcare technology.

## Who Can Join?
RISE-MICCAI is an inclusive initiative that welcomes researchers from all backgrounds. Participation is **not** restricted to individuals from LMICs. We encourage and celebrate diversity across age, gender, identity, race, and ethnicity. Whether you are a seasoned researcher, an early-career scientist, or a student, you are invited to be part of this growing and supportive community.

## How Can You Contribute to the JupyterBook?
You can contribute to the RISE-MICCAI JupyterBook by:
- **Adding Tutorials and Resources**: Share your knowledge by creating and submitting tutorials, guides, or research summaries relevant to MICCAI.
- **Improving Existing Content**: Review and enhance current materials, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
- **Providing Translations**: Help make the content accessible to a wider audience by translating materials into different languages.
- **Submitting Case Studies**: Share real-world applications and research insights to support the community's learning.
- **Collaborating on Open-Source Projects**: Engage with other researchers to develop interactive and code-based content.
