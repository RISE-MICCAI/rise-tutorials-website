## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Stage: Application & Model Diversity

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
To develop an applied understanding of more complex architectures and scenarios, including temporal data, pathology-specific tasks, and image modalities beyond 2D.

### ðŸ§  Topics

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Self-Supervised Learning** | Use unlabeled data with contrastive learning or predictive masking to pre-train models. |
| **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** | Apply GNNs to model anatomical relationships or patient similarity networks. |
| **Multi-Modal Learning (Advanced)** | Effectively fuse CT, MRI, PET, and structured clinical data for richer inference. |
| **Federated Learning (Practical)** | Explore challenges of data heterogeneity and model aggregation in clinical federations. |
| **3D Image Processing** | Extend CNNs and Transformers to volumetric data like CT and MRI scans. |
| **AI for Ultrasound Analysis** | Handle real-time, low-signal-quality imaging scenarios with AI. |
| **Radiomics & Feature Engineering** | Extract and interpret radiomic signatures for prediction and prognosis. |
| **Anomaly Detection & OOD Generalization** | Identify unexpected cases or detect failure modes in deployed AI systems. |
| **AI for Pathology & Histopathology** | Analyze gigapixel pathology slides for cancer grading and biomarker analysis. |
| **Survival Analysis & Risk Prediction** | Model time-to-event outcomes using classical and deep survival models. |
| **Time-Series Analysis for Patient Monitoring** | Analyze sequential patient data (e.g., vitals, labs) to predict deterioration. |
| **Bayesian Deep Learning** | Incorporate model uncertainty for robust medical decision-making. |
